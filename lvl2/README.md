# Level 2: Control Flow and Intermediate Concepts

Welcome to Level 2! In this section, you will build on your Python basics and learn how to control the flow of your programs. By the end of this level, you will be able to:

## What You'll Learn

- **Control Flow**
  - Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to make decisions in your code
  - Understanding and creating loops with `for` and `while`
  - Using `break` and `continue` to control loop execution

- **Comparison and Logical Operators**
  - Comparing values with `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
  - Combining conditions with `and`, `or`, and `not`

- **Bonus Concepts**
  - Using colors in print (asni)
  - Make it ease to use with dir

## Practice Files

- `stars.py` – Practice for loops and printing patterns
- `lvl2_lesson.py` – Practice control flow and user input
- `calc_lvl2.py` – Practice control flow and calculations
- `calc_lvl2-with_bonus.py` – Practice with additional bonus concepts
